This document has been drafted for Sendeo web service integrations. <a name="ole_link19"></a><a name="ole_link18"></a>It describes the web services to be used for the integration and the access to related services.

# <a name="_toc111207426"></a>General Information

Sendeo services run via the link <https://api.sendeo.com.tr>. The link also provides the opportunity to view Swagger and service-related information. Using the services requires getting customer-based tokens. This information is taken through Token/LoginAES service on a customer basis.  TLS 1.2 must be used for Access.

<a name="_toc111207456"></a>*Figure 1 Login Method Swagger*

There is a single test account for different customers in order to ensure easy monitoring of the integration tests both by the customer and Sendeo. Once tests are successfully completed, credentials (user name and password) to be used in the live environment should be requested from our Sales Team for "go-live".

Test ACCOUNT Information

“customer”: “**TEST”**

“password”: **TesT.43e54**

# <a name="_toc111207427"></a>Generic Cargo Integration

The working principle for Sendeo cargo integration is the creation of the shipment by means pickup operation on the side of Sendeo by using the information submitted/provided by the client via web service for their outbound cargo. 

With generic Web service integration, our client can perform the integration with a unique number (referenceNo) which the client creates the barcode on its own label or by generating Sendeo carriage barcode.

A unique number (referenceNo) is generated for shipment pickup. The client can track all states of the parcels/shipments using the unique number generated. The end user can track the shipment using the parametric tracking link received from the web service.





#### *Generic Cargo Integration workflow:*

1. The client transfers their shipment-related data to Sendeo system using "setdelivery".
1. The referenceNo info available within the data transferred to the system should be available on the barcode generated 
1. Prior to physical pickup, data can be cancelled using "cancelDelivery". Job orders for which pickup has been completed cannot be cancelled. Cancellation will not be possible since carriage has been started after the shipment creation.
1. Pickup is performed by means of reading the referenceNo generated by our client at the pickup phase
1. Following the shipment creation, the status of the shipment may be tracked with "trackdelivery" method
1. For clients who have provided/submitted Quantity and Deci/Kg info, after the data is submitted through SETDELIVERY service, cargo quantity and deci info for the order which is sent through CARGOMEASUREMENTUPDATE service should be re-submitted. After SETDELIVERY, if no deci info is submitted via CARGOMEASUREMENTUPDATE service, then the operation will proceed by measuring-weighing the shipment itself.
1. You can query the cityId and districtId information of the “SetDelivery” service from the “GetCityDistricts” service. You can access the city and district codes by querying the GetCityDistricts service by the name of the province or the name of the province/district. In case the relevant service is not used, access to our province and district codes via the province-district excel list in our technical document.

The cargo services offered for general use are above. Successful requests will return 200, failed/wrong requests will return error code 500 depending on the error message. It will return error 401 if authentication is not performed with token.

The main usage purposes of these services are briefly as follows:

SETDELIVERY

It allows customers to submit requests to Sendeo and to create Shipment/Job Order.

TRACKDELIVERY

It allows customers to submit requests to Sendeo and to track the pre-created Shipment using different data.

CANCELDELIVERY

It allows customers to cancel the pre-created Shipment/Job Order by means of submitting a request to Sendeo.

CARGOMEASUREMENTUPDATE

It allows customers to update quantity and measurement data for the pre-created Shipment/Job Order by means of submitting a request to Sendeo.

GETBARCODEBYTRACKINGNUMBER

It allows customers to get barcode using the tracking number for the pre-created Shipment/Job Order by means of submitting a request to Sendeo.
# <a name="_toc111207429"></a>SETDELIVERY
This is the service which allows customers to create shipment/job order on the side of Sendeo using specific data. It runs with POST method. Shipment/job order can be created in 6 different ways. These are:

- **DeliveryType 1:** Your Location >> Your Client: This is used for shipments which are going from Location to the Client. If there are multiple locations and separate invoice will be issued for each of these locations, then it should be managed with different users. If the invoice will be issued to the Main Client, then deliveryType=3 should be used.
- **DeliveryType 2:** Your Client >> Your Location: This is used for normal shipments from the Client to Location or for return shipment
- **DeliveryType 3:** Your Supplier etc. >> Your Client  
- **DeliveryType 4:** Re-shipment order (????)
- **DeliveryType 5:** Point of Delivery . This is used for shipments which will be delivered to Sendeo Point of Delivery
- **DeliveryType 6:** Point of Return. This is used for shipments which will be picked up from Sendeo Point of Return

Our Clients can create shipments between all units they work with. You can also receive service as delivery and return point.

With City and District info which we shared in the technical document, the shipment will be delivered to the branch office for the relevant city-district. 

Using the Ids provided to you as ID, you can target the branch info which you want to use for delivery and return point.
